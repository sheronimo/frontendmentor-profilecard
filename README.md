## Overview

Hi! This is my attempt at the Profile card component challenge.

Like with my recent approaches, I used SASS for my styling structure. This challenge was fairly straightforward, styling the background and styling the profile card itself.

## My process

1. I went for a mobile-first approach, first styling the background before moving onto the card.
2. After styling the card, I then fine-tuned the font sizing and spacing of components within the card itself.
3. I then fine-tuned the positioning of the background circles before running through the code again.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SASS
- Flexbox
- Grid

### What I learned

I learned about how to work with multiple background images and positioning them in different parts of the webpage. It was a bit of a struggle to get the positioning right.
